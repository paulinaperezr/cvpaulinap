<h1>Dreams</h1>
<p>I would love to go back to Euro pe specially Italy, it has been my favorite country up now. I want to work on something that makes me feel passionate about and be really successful when I grow up. I also want to have a great family with kids and a husband near my 30’s.
  My biggest dream right  now would be travelling to new countries in Europe as I loved it there.</p>

<h1>Pets</h1>
<p>Since I have memory I wish I had a dog or any kind of pets at my house, but my parents are still convinced it’s a huge responsibility to take care of and as we have school we won’t be able to do all the chores that requires having a dog, so they’ll end up doing all that stuff. I would love to have a dog but at this point I think I am going to have it when I’m older and I have my own house.</p>

<h1>Favorite</h1>
<p>  My favorite songs are by the artist Bad Bunny or Mora, I love their songs because they transmit me a lot of feelings and I love listening to them while I am working on something at school or when I am at my car. I love reggaeton and I listen to many songs of that music genre.</p>

<h1>Story Time</h1>
<p>When I was 7 years old we played hide and seek every recces at school. My friend Eloisa had to catch us and she accidentally got stuck on her lunchbox strip and she fell in front of all the cafeteria. Everyone went to complete silence immediately but Eloisa was all right it was just somehow funny because I literally saw everything and I didn’t expect her to fall when she was just about to catch me.</p>
